# Skirring-Infinity

## Project Overview

We will be building this game as our senior design year project, a space exploration game. The game allows players to explore vast procedurally generated planets, pilot spaceships, and interact with game environments to collect data and complete tasks on different planets as an Astronomer.

## Features

- **Procedurally Generated Planets**: Planets generated algorithmically with diverse biomes, atmospheres, and flora.
- **Shaders and Visual Effects**: Shaders for lighting, shadows, atmospheric scattering and emulation of space.
- **Spaceship Mechanics**: A spaceship affected by flight dynamics that the player will have to maintain in order to overcome challenging space environments.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface and in-game HUD allowing the player to navigate with ease and keep track of stats and essential information.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Planets, flora, and other celestial objects to discover.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Graphics**: ShaderLab/HLSL
- **Procedural Generation**: Implemented to create diverse and engaging environments.
